# Biological Imaging Methods Ontology

This is an ontology for the description of sample preparation,
visualisation, and imaging methods used in biomedical research.

## History
The ontology was originally developed by [FlyBase](https://flybase.org/)
until circa 2005. The latest version edited by FlyBase is available on
<https://s3ftp.flybase.org/releases/FB2025_02/precomputed_files/ontologies/image.obo.gz>.

It was later extended and used by several groups beyond FlyBase,
including:

* Chris Woodcock and the [Cell Image Library](http://www.cellimagelibrary.org/);
* Willy Wong and the Center for Research in Biological Systems (version
  [available on GitHub](https://github.com/CRBS/Biological_Imaging_Methods_Ontology));
* David Osumi-Sutherland as part of the PhenoImageShare project (version
  [available on Github](https://github.com/Imaging-semantics/fbbi)).

From 2026 onwards, the ontology is maintained by a joint effort under the
umbrella of the [FoundingGIDE](https://founding-gide.eurobioimaging.eu) project.
